        <b style="text-decoration: none">House Blends</b>
        can often be described as reliable and straightforward – a blend that is
        a “go-to” in a coffee shop. They are generally seen as a consistent and
        high-value product that you can count on. The brew of a house blend
        coffee is different than that of a breakfast blend or espresso roast –
        meaning that when you pour a cup of a house blend coffee, you should
        expect to fall somewhere in the middle of a light roast and dark roast
        and have intermediate flavor

        <b style="text-decoration: none">French Roast Coffee</b> is a
        dark-roasted coffee with intense flavor, smoky taste and charred aroma
        originating from Europe. Its rich, intense flavor, robust taste and
        smoky aroma characterize it. It's believed to have originated in France
        during the 1800s; however it has since spread all over the world. When
        roasting French Roast Coffee at home or commercially, the beans are
        typically brought up to around 485 °F (252 °C) – which takes somewhere
        between 8–10 minutes depending on the roaster type and size of the batch
        being roasted

        <b style="text-decoration: none">Colombian Coffee</b> has a beautifully
        unique taste and tends to be sold at a higher price point as it is
        mostly made up of the superior arabica bean, which comes at a cost!
        Colombian coffee is known for its low acidity that is balanced with a
        sweetness that isn’t dissimilar to caramel and can have heavy notes of
        chocolate and nuts. Although there are also many other varieties
        depending on the crops, which have a variety of flavor notes that are
        lighter, more fruity, and floral. Another factor that makes Colombian
        Coffee stand out, is that a wet (washed) process is used in the
        production. This process is known to produce a more palatable acidity
        within the beans, making it a more highly regarded process than the dry
        process used in African and Asian Coffee production
